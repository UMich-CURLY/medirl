# vehicle-motion-forecasting
## Work in progress.

This repository contains the training and inference code used in our paper *[Integrating kinematics and environment context into deep inverse reinforcement learning for predicting off-road vehicle trajectories]*. This work proposes a inverse reinforcement learning based framework that combines environment and kinematic context to infer the reward structure which affects the vehicle's motion.
