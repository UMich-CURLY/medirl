# vehicle-motion-forecasting
## Work in progress.

This repository contains the training and inference code used in our paper *[Integrating kinematics and environment context into deep inverse reinforcement learning for predicting off-road vehicle trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07225)*. This work proposes a inverse reinforcement learning based framework that infers the reward structure and forecasts the vehicle's motion.
